// templates, they are also called as parameterized classes
// why to use templates: 1.DRY(do not repeat yourself) 2. generic programming 
/*
these templates can be used to represent many classes, mainly used in competitive programming
syntax of templates
template <class T> //here T can be int, float, char ,etc... 
class vector
{
    T*arr;
    public:
        vector(T*arr)
        {
            //code
        }
        // and many other methods
};
int main()
{
    vector<int>vector(ptr);
    vector<float>vector(ptr);
}

// STL(standard template library) is mainly used for competitive programming
